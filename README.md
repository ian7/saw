# Warning 
This project is not actively maintained. Please feel free to play with it. YMMV

# Another warning
This repository contains an academic-grade code that has been produced in rush and with insufficient resources. 
It is probably as far from 'learning example' as it gets ;)
You've been warned.

# Giving it a try
Given enough effort invested into collecting all the (outdated) dependencies, it should be possible to run SAW natively on your machine. 
If you are here only to see what it can do for you, I'd strongly advise you to check out a [docker image available on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ian7/saw)

# Analysis  
A set of scripts that I have used to analyze user's behavior during design workshops. For details see [dissertation](http://design.inf.usi.ch/sites/default/files/biblio/marcin-nowak-phd-software-architecture-warehouse.pdf) chapter 8.
